# Airbnc Property Booking App

AirBNC is a full‑stack booking project. The application allows users to browse properties, view detailed property, manage bookings, leave reviews, and update their profiles, bookings and favourited properties.

This project demonstrates the ability to build a complete web application from frontend UI/UX with React, user flows (authentication, bookings, reviews, favourites), to a back‑end REST API with Express and PostgreSQL.

### Users can:

- Search properties by **location**, **dates** and **guests**
- Filter properties by **property type**, **price** and **amenities**
- Sort properties by **Cost per night**, **Popularity** and **Favourite** and order by **Ascending** and **Descending**
- View detailed property pages including images, full descriptions, host info, amenities, ratings, reviews, and availability dates for booking
- Mark/unmark properties as **favorites**
- Book properties, edit or cancel reservations, and view booking history
- Leave reviews (rating + comment), and delete their own reviews
- Update personal profile information (name, email, phone number)
- View and update **Profile** from their profile page
- View and update **bookings** from their booking page
- View and update **favourites** from their profile favourites page
